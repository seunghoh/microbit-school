Welcome to micro:bit coding school. This repository is for providing source code and related materials.
The tutorials are uploaded to the YouTube Channel https://bit.ly/hohparkCoding.

## Download 
If you are not familiar with GitHub, you can just download the code. Select `Clone or download` button and select `Download ZIP`

Unzip the downloaded zip file, then you can see the same folder as you can see in this repository.

## Folder structure
In each folder of lecture, there are `.hex` and `.js` file. I also uploaded the image file which I used in the lecture.

## Import hex file
`.hex` file is created by the micro:bit editor when you select download button of the editor. For more information about the `.hex` file format, please refer the micro:bit developer page: https://tech.microbit.org/software/hex-format/

You can import `.hex` file by dragging into your microbit makecode page: https://makecode.microbit.org/ or select the `Import` button on this page, and select the `Import File...` menu.

## Use JavaScript Editor
I uploaded `.js` file just incase `.hex` file has a problem in your micro:bit editor. You can select the `New Project` menu, then select `{} JavaScript` menu on top of the editor. Open `.js` file in your any text editor you like, copy the whole code and paste into the micro:bit JavaScript editor.

Now, you can go back to `Block` mode or you can keep coding in the `JavaScript` mode.

## Enjoy!
I am looking forward to seeing in the lecture, enjoy the coding!
